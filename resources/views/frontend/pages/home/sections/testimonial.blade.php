                                <p>People use languages to express their experience. However, each language is uniquely adapted for expressing only certain parts of our experience and is less effective for describing other parts</p>

                                <p>There are very few people in this world with enough self-confidence, or self-importance, that they truly don't care what others think of them. Unless you're one of those people--and I'm certainly not--being late is bound to rattle you at least a little as you head into your meeting or appointment.</p>

                                <p>There are many ways to respond to inappropriate behaviors, of course, and they vary in how much they focus on the immediate behavior compared to longer-term features or patterns of a studentâ€™s behavior. There are so many ways to respond, in fact, that we can describe only a sample of the possibilities here. None are effective all of the time, though all do work at least some of the time.</p>
